## 00. Load libraries ----------------------------------------------------

# install.packages("tidyverse", "corrplot")
library(tidyverse) # we will use this library, which comes with its own syntax
library(jtools) # `theme_apa` for plotting
library(corrplot) # visualize correlations
library(stats)
library(sjPlot) # plot regression output

#
## 01. Import data ------------------------------------------------------

raw_df <- read.csv("framingham.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

############################### DATA EXPLORATION ####################


## Explore data ---------------------------------------------------------

str(raw_df) # prints out the structure of the dataframe

# we can already tell that sex should be changed to a categorical variable, not kept as an integer
# what about education? it looks like education only ranges from 1-4
# let's take a closer look

count(raw_df, education) # counts the unique values in the `education` column of the `raw_df` data frame and their frequency

# you can also use the table function to tabulate the values in a column
table(raw_df$education)

# or in a combination of columns
table(raw_df$education, raw_df$currentSmoker)
table(raw_df$education, raw_df$currentSmoker, raw_df$prevalentStroke)

# OK, so education only has four values or missing data (NA) 
# this means that each number corresponds to some educational attainment (refer back to the dataset description)
# (e.g., did not complete high school, completed high school/GED, went to some university/college, graduated from university/college)
# as these are different types of education, we can treat this column as a categorical variable (i.e., factor) or as an ordinal variable (i.e., integer)

# other notable columns that are currently set as integers (because they contain 1s and 0s)
# but are coded as binary outcomes (i.e., yes/no or TRUE/FALSE) include:
# currentSmoker, BPMeds, prevalentStroke, prevalentHyp, diabetes, and TenYearCHD
# these columns should be coded as factors as well

# might want to change the measurement variables (e.g., heartRate, sysBP, diaBP, totChol, and glucose to numeric)
# `BMI` is fine as numeric

# 02. Data preparation in base R -----------------------------------------

# first, create a new dataframe that essentially duplicates the raw dataframe
prepped_df_base <- as.data.frame(raw_df)

# change the class of selected variables to factors and numeric
# we can use `mutate_at()` to change the class of several variables at once
# the syntax is `mutate_at(df, c(variables), function)`
# function can be `factor` or `as.numeric`, in our case
# our factor variables: "male", "education", "currentSmoker", "BPMeds", "prevalentStroke", "prevalentHyp", "diabetes", "TenYearCHD"
# our numeric variables: "age", "cigsPerDay", "totChol", "sysBP", "diaBP", "heartRate", "glucose"
prepped_df_base <- mutate(prepped_df_base, 
                          across(c(), 
                          as.factor))
prepped_df_base <- mutate(prepped_df_base,
                          across(c(), 
                          as.numeric))

# create a new column for sex
prepped_df_base$sex <- ifelse(prepped_df_base$male == 1, "M", "F") # `ifelse` is useful when you have a binary set of values as output 

# assign descriptive values to the education variable  
# `case_when` is useful/cleaner to use when there are multiple possible output values
# we want to replace the numbers with the following values:
# "< High School", "High School Graduate", "Some College", and "College Graduate"
# creates a new column called education_class, to distinguish it from education (the ordinal variable)
prepped_df_base$education_class <- case_when()

str(prepped_df_base)

# education_class and sex have been changed to `chr`, but they are supposed to be categorical variables 
# change the class of the sex and education variables
prepped_df_base$sex <- as.factor(prepped_df_base$sex)
prepped_df_base$education_class <- as.factor(prepped_df_base$education_class)

str(prepped_df_base) # everything looks good now

# create new data frames to select only a subset of the sample for later analyses 
# data frame 1: participants who have coronary heart disease in 10 years (i.e., `TenYearCHD == 1`)
# data frame 2: participants who do not have coronary heart disease in 10 years (i.e., `TenYearCHD == 0`)

# there are two ways to do this in base R: using `filter()` or using `subset()`
# 1. using `filter()` -- can be used to select rows containing specific values
prepped_df_base_chd <- filter(df, df$var == condition)
prepped_df_base_no_chd <- filter(df, df$var == condition)

# 2. using `subset()` -- can be used to select rows containing specific values AND specific columns 
prepped_df_base_chd2 <- subset(df, var == condition)
prepped_df_base_no_chd2 <- subset(df, var == condition)

# check that the two data frames are the same
all.equal(prepped_df_base_chd, prepped_df_base_chd2, check.attributes = FALSE) # row numbers are different between the data frames 
all.equal(prepped_df_base_no_chd, prepped_df_base_no_chd2, check.attributes = FALSE) # row numbers are different between the data frames 

## CHALLENGE: create a new data frames for male participants who develop CHD in 10 years 
prepped_df_base_male_chd <- filter()

#
# 02b. Data preparation using tidyr ----------------------------------------------------

# let's create a new dataframe where we make all those changes
# we will use the tidyverse library to do this

prepped_df_tidy <- raw_df %>%  # this is a pipe; it allows you to perform a sequence of actions on a single object
  # now let's first change some of the variables to factors and numerics
  # the mutate_at function will take a vector of the column names you want to change to factor 
  # and apply the `factor` function to those variables in the `prepped_df_tidy` dataframe
  mutate_at(c("male", "education", "currentSmoker", "BPMeds", "prevalentStroke", "prevalentHyp", "diabetes", "TenYearCHD"), 
            as.factor) %>% 
  mutate_at(c("age", "cigsPerDay", "totChol", "sysBP", "diaBP", "heartRate", "glucose"),
            as.numeric) %>% 
  # let's also change the values in the male and education columns to make them more descriptive
  # and convert them to factors all at once
  mutate(sex = as.factor(ifelse(male == 1, "M", "F")),                              
         education_class = as.factor(case_when(education == 1 ~ "< High School",
                                         education == 2 ~ "High School Graduate",
                                         education == 3 ~ "Some College",
                                         education == 4 ~ "College Graduate"))) 

# check that the dataframes created using tidyr and base R are identical
all.equal(prepped_df_base, prepped_df_tidy) # TRUE

# create new data frames for those with and without CHD in 10 years
prepped_df_chd <- prepped_df_tidy %>% 
  filter(var == condition)

prepped_df_no_chd <- prepped_df_tidy %>% 
  filter(var == condition)

# check that the prepped_df_chd and prepped_df_no_chd produced using tidyr are the 
# same as those produced using base R

all.equal(prepped_df_chd, prepped_df_base_chd) # TRUE
all.equal(prepped_df_no_chd, prepped_df_base_no_chd) # TRUE

# you can also use filter to select observations based on specific criteria using the `&` (and) and the `|` (or) operators
# for example, to select high school and college graduates only:

hs_coll_grads <- prepped_df_tidy %>% 
  filter(condition1 | condition2)

# to select high school graduates who develop CHD:

hs_grads_chd <- prepped_df_tidy %>% 
  filter(condition1 & condition2)

# you can also use the `%in%` operator for conciseness
# to select high school graduates, college graduates, or some college attendees who are male:

male_grads <- prepped_df_tidy %>% 
  filter(var %in% list & sex == "M")

# the `ifelse()` statement is also handy for 

## TIDYVERSE vs BASE R
# note that in base R, you have to continuously refer to the dataframe and variable names
# especially inside functions, whereas you can reference the dataframe using a `.` with tidyverse
# also note that you have to run multiple lines of code when using base R for each new change
# this can be accomplished in one go using tidyverse 

# for simplicity, I will create duplicate the above data frame as assign it to `prepped_df`

prepped_df <- as.data.frame(prepped_df_tidy)

#

# Create a summarized data frame -------------------------------------------

## You can get a high level summary of the dataframe using the summary() function
# it provides you with basic descriptive stats like interquartile range, mean, min/max, and number of NAs 

summary(prepped_df)

## You can also create a summarized dataframe by some grouping variable
# for example, if you want to see the average values of some variables according to 
# 1. whether someone had CHD or not and 2. their educational attainment

chd_summary_df <- prepped_df %>% 
  # remove missing data from the education_class variable
  filter(!is.na(education_class)) %>% 
  group_by(TenYearCHD, education_class) %>% 
  # summarize variables - use sum() to count the true cases in the binary variables (e.g., 1s for currentSmoker), 
  # n() to count the total number of participants
  # mean() to get the average of the numeric variables, and
  # round() to round the output to the desired number of decimal places
  summarize(n_participants = n(), # create a new variable to count the number of participants in each grouping
            age = round(mean(age, na.rm = T), 0), # `na.rm = T` ensures that NAs are ignored in the calculation, otherwise you get NA as the output
            currentSmoker = sum(currentSmoker == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
            prop_smokers = round(currentSmoker/n_participants, 2), # create a new variable to calculate the proportion of smokers 
            cigsPerDay = round(mean(cigsPerDay, na.rm = T), 2))

## You can add more/fewer variables to this, depending on what you're interested in looking at
